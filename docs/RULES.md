## Battles

Battling in Command-Line-War is a math game. There are two type of battles optional and forced. There are situational battles depending on the choice the player makes in the game that is optional. Then there is battles that occur no matter the choice.
### In Battle

When in battle the user has a few options. The options are flee, defense, eat
and attack. A note of importance, during a battle session you cannot go to
the menu. The battle will run until either you escape, kill the enemy or the
enemy kills you. The battle runs based on turns so when you make a choice make
it count because the enemy's turn is next.
#### Attack

If you choose to attack then the game will ask for a few more details such as
what weapon in your inventory that you would like to use. Once your weapon is selected then its damage is inflicted on the enemy and the weapon of choice looses it's quality. To see more on weapon's check the weapons portion of the RULES.md file.

#### Eat

If you choose to eat you can add to your health, but sacrificing a turn. This
could be useful in case you are in low health or need a boost.

#### Fleeing

If you choose the option to flee during the battle, dice are rolled. In random
chance you may or may not escape from the battle. By chance that you escape from
the battle you receive 1 ration and a get away from battle free card. If your
escape attempt fails, then the enemy gets a free attack. There is a limit of 3 attempts of escape per battle.

### Before and After battle

Before and after a battle it would be wise to check your weapon quality, health, inventory and more. Before a battle would be the wise time to repair a weapon, buy a new weapon or get some extra rations.

enemy is equipped with a weapon, health and self interest. In a
battle on their turn they never flee they only attack.
