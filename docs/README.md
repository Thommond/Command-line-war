checked out the rules?" and now you are here. The next question would
be introducing you to the basics of the game like the plot and MVP rules.

## The Basics

You are a soldier in the era of WW2. The mission is to invade Nazi territory and make it home safe to your family. You are given 10 rations, 1 rifle, 1
gas mask and your own hands. With that and your expert knowledge you are tasked with going through a series of questions to complete your mission and get home.
